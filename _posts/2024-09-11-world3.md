title: World3 model implementations
---

The [World3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3) model from 1972
indicates that "Business as Usual" (BAU) would lead to a collapse
around 2030. [A comparison with empirical data](
https://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yale-publication-1.pdf),
made by [Gaya Herrington](https://gayaherrington.com/), now 50 years
later is really scary.  I wanted to dig deeper into this, and run the
World3 model myself. There are several World3 simulation programs
available, and this post is about how I ran some of them (it wasn't
hard).

There are links to Model implementations on the [wikipedia page](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3). I have tried the Javascript and
Python models. The "modelica" links seem broken, but I hope to get back
to the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) model.

I am using Linux ([Ubuntu 24.04](https://ubuntu.com/blog/tag/ubuntu-24-04-lts)),
and will not try other OS'es. I expect no big differences for other
Linux distributions though.


## Javascript simulator

By far the simplest to use! Go to the [web-page](
http://bit-player.org/extras/limits/ltg.html), and click "Run".

The default is the original "Business as Usual" (BAU) simulation where
a rapid decrease begins around 2030, caused by shortage of
resources. Since 1972 more resources has been found (e.g
[fracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking)), and you may try
the "BAU2" simulation by adjusting the "initial resources multiplier"
to `2`. In this scenario the rapid decrease begins around 2050, and is
caused by pollution (i.e climate change).

The source is available on [github](https://github.com/bit-player/limits)
(but you don't need it).

## Python preparations

Install Python dependencies, and use a variable for the "workspace"
where everything is stored:
```
sudo apt install -y git python3-pip python3-full python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib
WS=$HOME/world3    # (you probably want to use another directory)
mkdir -p $WS
```


## Pyworld3

The [pyworld3](https://github.com/cvanwynsberghe/pyworld3) model is
written in Python and is intended to be as close to the original from
1972 as possible.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cvanwynsberghe/pyworld3 $WS/pyworld3
cd $WS/pyworld3
python example_world3_standard.py
evince fig_world3_standard_a.pdf
```

The `example_world3_standard.py` simulates the BAU scenario, and the
simulated graphs are overlaid on top of the original graphs to show
the conformance (which is perfect). With a minimum of Python skills
you can alter the initial values for different simulations.


## MyWorld3

[MyWorld3](https://github.com/Juji29/MyWorld3) is another Python
model. All documentation is in the `pdf` file, even a diagram of the
original World3 model.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Juji29/MyWorld3 $WS/MyWorld3
cd $WS/MyWorld3/MyWorld3
python world3_run.py
```

As described in the pdf, you can edit the `N_SCENARIO` in
world3_run.py to simulate different scenarios.


## PyWorld3-03

[PyWorld3-03](https://github.com/TimSchell98/PyWorld3-03) is an
upgrade of [pyworld3](https://github.com/cvanwynsberghe/pyworld3).  It
was used to [recalibrate the world3 model parameters to match empiric
data](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jiec.13442).

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/TimSchell98/PyWorld3-03.git $WS/PyWorld3-03
cd $WS/PyWorld3-03
# (no graphs were printed at the time of writing, hence...)
echo -e "\nplt.show()" >> run_different_standard_configurations.py
python run_different_standard_configurations.py
```
