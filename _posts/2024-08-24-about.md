title: About me and this blog
---

About who I am, what I intend to write about, and why I'm doing it.

I am now 63 years old, and basically retired. I have worked for
Ericsson from 1982 until 2023 (41 years!). I have been a SW designer
all the time, and liked it, so I continue to learn and contribute to
open source projects.
