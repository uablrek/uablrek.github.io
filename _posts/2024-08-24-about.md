title: About me and this blog

Who I am, what I intend to write about, and why I'm doing it.

I am now 63 years old. I have worked for Ericsson from 1982 until 2023
(41 years!). I have been a SW designer all the time, and liked it, so
I continue to learn and contribute to open source projects. I am
[opentowork on linked-in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lars-ekman-2711293/),
but can endure to retirement if nothing comes my way.

I will write about programming and computer topics that I work with,
and what else that comes to mind. I write primarily for myself, to
structure my thoughts. "You should never think you know something
until you have tried to explain it to others". I put that as a
quotation, but I might have made it up myself.


## Nostalgia

It's easy to become nostalgic when you get old. I have seen so much in
my working days. In 1982 it was a different world! No internet, no
cell-phones, not even personal computers. I have seen it all happen.

I started wo work with mainframes like [Univac
1100/62](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_1100/2200_series) and
[IBM 3083](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_308X). It wasn't very
fun, so after a year I started writing
[microcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode) for processors in the
[AXE exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AXE_telephone_exchange).
That was great fun. You can't get any more low-level.

In 1985 I started working with PC's. It was a *very dynamic* time with
PC usage exploding. We were early with LAN, and my boss insisted on
using this weird thing called "TCP/IP", when everybody *knew* that
[Novell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell) was the future of networking.

I went to [University](https://www.ltu.se/en) 1988-1992 to upgrade my
BSc to a MSc. I came back to Ericsson and landed in the "AXE-N"
project that should to modernize the AXE exchange. I will resist to
rant about it, but the project was horrible, and was cancelled 1995.
Some techical sub-projects were however very cutting-edge and interresting.

I went to work with [Asynchronous Transfer Mode](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode) (ATM) which
everybody *knew* was the future of networking. Both in AXE-N and ATM I
worked with what's now would be called "embedded systems". I sadly
left that area around 2000, but would really like to go back.

From around 2000 I worked with Computer Clusters. First own
developed clusters, then [Service Availability Forum](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Availability_Forum) (SAF), which
everybody *knew* was the future of High Availability (HA)
clusters. SAF was awful, and is now dead (fortunately).

Networking and load-balancing had always been part of my work with
clusters but became my main task from around 2010. In 2018 I started
working full time with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). My
mission was to contribute to get IPv6 support to work, and to
contribute in the dual-stack effort. This may have been my best time
at Ericsson since the embedded system days.

In 2023 I accepted a voluntary layoff program, and quit at Ericsson in
May.
